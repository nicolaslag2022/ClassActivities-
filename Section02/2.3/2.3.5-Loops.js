// Follow the steps below to create a **while** loop that TOTALS the numbers from 1 to 100

// 1) create a variable to represent the current number
let curNum = 100;
let i = 1;
let cureToal = 0:
// 2) create a variable to represent the current total
while (i <=n curNum ) {
  console.log(num);
  num++;
}
// 3) write a while loop that sums the numbers from 1 to 100
let curNum = 100;


// Now using the same variables you created in steps 1 and 2, create a **for** loops that TOTALS the numbers from 1 to 100

// 1) write a for loop that sums the numbers from 1 to 100
